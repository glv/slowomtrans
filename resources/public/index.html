<p>
    Each of these counters is incremented in a background
    <code>core.async</code> <code>go-loop</code>, from 1 to 50.  Each counter
    is accompanied by a vector of maps, which is transacted into the app state
    alongside the counter.  However, the vectors are never referred to by a
    component query, nor are they referenced in any way during rendering.  They
    are simply added to the application state each time the counter is updated.

<p>
    If you run the counters in order, you will see that if the vector is
    small (100 elements) the loop runs quickly.  If the vector is large (10K
    elements) but "hidden" from the parser by being wrapped in an atom, it also
    runs quickly.  But when a 10K-element vector is transacted directly into
    the application state, it slows things down a lot.

    This may seem contrived, but the real use comes from
    <a href="https://github.com/glv/snergly">Snergly</a>, a play project where
    I'm implementing maze-related algorithms in Clojure and animating those
    algorithms in the browser. I use Om Next to implement the control panel
    where you choose the maze algorithm and grid size (and eventually other
    parameters) and then the algorithm runs using <code>core.async</code>,
    sending each grid update through a channel, at the other end of which it is
    transacted into the app state and then used to draw the current state of
    the grid on a canvas.

<p>
    Interestingly, once counter 3 has been run after a reload, counter 1 and
    counter 2 become slow as well.
